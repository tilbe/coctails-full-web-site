<h1>üç∏CocoBar Web Site </h1>



<h3>üñäÔ∏èApp Preview </h3>



<p>Hello,

I would like to share the "Cocktail Website" project I undertook to enhance my front-end skills. In this project, I delved into the fundamentals of web design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also utilizing Map and Local Storage technologies to enrich the user experience.

HTML and CSS played a pivotal role in shaping the site's appearance. However, the essence of the project lay in JavaScript. I employed JavaScript's Map structure to organize data systematically and make it accessible. Moreover, through Local Storage, I managed to offer personalized experiences by remembering user preferences.

The experience gained from this project underscored the importance of blending design with functionality. Additionally, it provided me with an opportunity to learn how to leverage JavaScript effectively to make websites more captivating.

Thank you.. </p>
